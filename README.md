# Context Engineering Implementation Reference Scaffold

Public reference scaffold for Context Engineering implementation.

## Purpose

This repository preserves a public reference copy of the implementation mechanics for agent/repo operations, including scripts, generators, and operational workflows.

Normative dependency direction:

- governance -> implementation -> role repositories

## Scope

Included in bootstrap:

- execution scripts under `00-os/scripts/`
- operational workflows under `.github/workflows/`
- generator sources under `10-templates/repo-starters/`
- tooling configuration inputs (`00-os/role-registry.yml`, `00-os/governed-repos.yml`)

## Contract Versioning

Governance contract consumption is pinned and validated via:

- `contracts/upstream/governance-implementation-contract.json`
- `contracts/governance-contract-lock.json`
- `00-os/scripts/validate-governance-contract-consumption.py`

CI enforces contract version compatibility and boundary constraints.

## Boundary Gates

Boundary drift is enforced by CI in:

- `BOUNDARY_GATES.md`
- `.github/workflows/validate-boundary-implementation.yml`

## Authority Boundary

This repository is a public, non-authoritative reference scaffold.
The authoritative implementation/tooling source for the Josh-Phillips-LLC org lives in:

- `Josh-Phillips-LLC/context-engineering-implementation`

Governance policy decisions, approval rules, and protected-path definitions are authoritative in:

- `Josh-Phillips-LLC/context-engineering-governance`

See `CONTRACT_BOUNDARY.md` and `MIGRATION_PROVENANCE.md`.
